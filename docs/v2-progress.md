# v2 Progress

Owner: created by P0.4. Written alongside the code it describes, in the same
commit, from P0.4 onward. P0.1-P0.3 recorded their acceptance evidence in
`docs/v2-discovery.md` — this table carries their status and evidence
pointer forward, but the full write-up stays in that file, not duplicated
here.

**Git is the authority on what landed. This table is the authority on intent
and evidence.** Reconcile with `git log --all --oneline --grep "^v2("` before
trusting a `done` row.

Status values: `not started`, `in progress`, `done`. Nothing is marked `done`
if it is partially implemented — see Remaining for what's left instead.

## Standing decisions from the P0.4 approval gate

- **Corpus target size: 3,000 titles.** The Tuning table's provisional
  default, confirmed by the user at this gate after reviewing P0.3's
  feasibility numbers (≈2m51s seed time, ≈5.4 MB pruned on disk at the
  70%-of-30/min safety margin — well inside every measured budget). P1.4
  transcribes this into `config/tuning.js`.
- **P5A.1 is blocked.** The user has decided to pause corpus-building work
  until AniList's ToS language ("not a backup or data storage service," "no
  mass collection of data," quoted in `docs/v2-discovery.md`'s P0.2 section)
  is clarified. This is not resolved by P0.4 — it is recorded here as an
  active block on the P5A.1 row and, transitively, on GATE-2.1. Do not start
  P5A.1 until the user lifts this block.
- **`addedAt` date-range anomaly: cause unknown**, per the user's answer at
  this gate. See `docs/v2-backlog.md`. Non-blocking, but no substep should
  treat `addedAt` as a reliable long-horizon signal without asking again.

## P0.4 close out

Work done this session, in commit order:
1. `docs/v2-plan.md`, this file, and `docs/v2-backlog.md` created
   (`v2(P0.4): plan, progress and backlog files`).
2. `datadir.js`/`server.js`: `ANIME_TRACKER_DATA_DIR` and `ANIME_TRACKER_PORT`
   env-var overrides added, additive only
   (`v2(P0.4): data dir and port env overrides`).
3. Playwright installed as the project's first devDependency (test tooling
   only — the shipped app stays zero-dependency);
   `playwright.config.js`, `tests/e2e/harness.js`,
   `tests/e2e/harness-smoke.spec.js`, `scripts/perf.js`,
   `tests/fixtures/generate-perf-library.js` and its output
   `tests/fixtures/perf-library-2000.json` added
   (`v2(P0.4): playwright and perf harness`).

Acceptance criteria, applying the spec's own "How the criteria reduce for
P0.4" (P0.4 ships plan documents and a test harness, no UI):

**1. Automated checks — full, as required.**
- `node tests/run-all.js` (the existing zero-dependency unit suite, untouched
  by this substep): **59 passed, 0 failed**, unchanged from P0.1-P0.3.
- The production preview command (`npm start`, i.e. `node server.js`, no
  build step exists in this project) was started for real via the committed
  `.claude/launch.json` config and confirmed serving the real library
  (12 watching entries visible, matching P0.1's measured counts) — proving
  the env-var overrides are true no-ops when unset.
- `npm run test:e2e` (Playwright, against a real server + real Chromium,
  booted by `tests/e2e/harness.js` against a temp fixture directory, never
  the real app-data folder): **1 passed** — the smoke test loads a
  schema-v1 fixture, confirms the app's existing migration chain runs it up
  to schema v4, and confirms the migrated entry renders.
- `npm run perf` (the perf script, against the 2,000-entry synthetic
  fixture): produced a real, measured number —
  **p95 first-paint time: 1004ms** (7 runs: 972/959/968/981/1004/970/996ms)
  against the Tuning table's 200ms budget for "Library list render, 2,000
  entries." **Over budget, and expected to be**: this app has no
  virtualization yet (`renderGrid()` renders every row; the Global
  constraints' virtualization requirement and P4.1/P4.3/P4.4's work land
  later). This is a real, useful measurement recorded for whoever
  implements virtualization to compare against, not a failure of this
  substep — P0.4's own reduction only requires that the perf script can
  produce a number end to end, which it did.
- No lint, typecheck, or build command exists in this project (unchanged
  finding from P0.1), stated explicitly rather than skipped.

**2. Data safety — not applicable, as required.** Nothing was persisted to
the real `library.json` or any other real Class A data. The harness reads
and writes exclusively inside OS temp directories it creates and tears down
itself (`fs.mkdtempSync`/`fs.rmSync` in `tests/e2e/harness.js`); the one live
check against the real app (above) opened the real server read-only and
made no library-modifying request.

**3. Manual smoke test — restated as a document walkthrough, as required.**
What the user can check: open `docs/v2-plan.md` and confirm the substep list
matches `docs/v2-prompts.md`'s Substep table, in the same dependency order,
with the architecture-correction section addressing the no-IndexedDB
finding up front. Open `docs/v2-progress.md` (this file) and confirm P0.1,
P0.2 and P0.3 read `done` with an evidence pointer into
`docs/v2-discovery.md`, and that P0.4 now reads `done` with its evidence
recorded here, in this closing commit.

**4. Performance — not applicable except the one required demonstration,
which applies.** The perf script measured "Library list render, 2,000
entries" end to end and printed a real p95 number (1004ms) against the
named budget (200ms), per above. No other Tuning-table surface is touched
by this substep.

**5. Accessibility — not applicable, as required.** No UI was added or
changed by this substep.

**6. Rollback.** Revert, in reverse order: `v2(P0.4): playwright and perf
harness`, `v2(P0.4): data dir and port env overrides`,
`v2(P0.4): plan, progress and backlog files`. All three are additive:
the env-var overrides are no-ops when unset (verified above), and nothing
downstream has been built against the harness or the plan/progress/backlog
files yet, so there is no forward-compatibility concern. No data or
production behavior is at risk from a revert.

**Status: P0.4 complete.** All six criteria addressed per the spec's own
P0.4 reduction — three as full, real demonstrations (automated checks,
performance, the perf number) and three as explicit not-applicable/restated
per the reduction rule, none skipped. Pending the user's confirmation to
merge `v2/P0.4` into `main`.
